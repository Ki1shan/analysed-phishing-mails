EMAIL OVERVIEW:
This phishing email pretends to be from Wells Fargo and warns the recipient that their security key has expired. It urges the user to reactivate the key through a link that leads to a suspicious domain.

PHISHING INDICATORS IDENTIFIED:
1. The sender’s address is inmail-hit-reply@linkedin.com, which has nothing to do with Wells Fargo. It is either spoofed or deliberately misleading.
2. The email includes a link to http://cabinetkignima.com/Wellsfargo_keys_account5/page2.html, a domain unrelated to Wells Fargo. This is likely a phishing site.
3. It uses fear tactics, stating that the “Personal Security Key… has expired,” which is meant to create urgency and provoke action.
4. There are multiple grammar and spelling mistakes, like “Key your for your Wells Fargo Account,” which further undermine its credibility.
5. The email uses a generic greeting, “Dear James,” which may be scraped or randomly generated. Professional emails often include verified personalization.
6. It confusingly uses both LinkedIn and Wells Fargo branding in the same email, which no legitimate company would do.
7. The link is insecure and uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, which is a red flag when dealing with financial institutions.

TOOLS USED:
1. MessageHeader: To validate SPF/DKIM 
2. URLVoid: To confirm the link was malicious.
