X-Mailer: Some Phishing Kit v2.0  
Reply-To: "Microsoft Support" <support@microsoft-security.xyz>  

EMAIL OVERVIEW:
This phishing email claims to be a security alert from Microsoft, warning the user of unusual sign-in activity from a suspicious location. It prompts the user to take urgent action by clicking a link or calling a phone number.

PHISHING INDICATORS IDENTIFIED:
1. The sender email address is no-reply_msteam2@outlook.com, which is a free Outlook address and not an official Microsoft domain. This raises suspicion of spoofing.
2. It mentions an IP address 293.09.101.9, which is technically invalid since the first number exceeds the allowed IP range. This is an intentional scare tactic.
3. The content uses urgent language like threats of license corruption and prohibited connections to panic the user.
4. The email includes a phone number 1-800-816-0380 that is not a verifiable Microsoft support number. Scammers often use fake numbers to lure victims.
5. There are noticeable grammar issues, such as awkward sentence structures that legitimate corporations usually avoid.
6. The “Review recent activity” button has a hidden destination, possibly leading to a phishing page.

TOOLS USED:
1. MessageHeader: To trace the email’s path (like tracking a package).  
2. IPVoid: To check if the sender’s IP was blacklisted (it was).
